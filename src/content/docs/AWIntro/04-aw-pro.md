With the Airland World Editor, you’ll have complete creative freedom over your assets, servers, and gameplay mechanics. Whether you're building premium experiences within Airland World, where players can use their existing avatars and immerse themselves in your creations, or developing fully standalone games using Airland’s underlying technology, the choice is yours.

For creators who design experiences within Airland World, your content becomes instantly accessible to a global player base, integrated seamlessly with the existing ecosystem. Players can jump into your missions, explore your regions, or participate in your events using their avatars.

Alternatively, for standalone games, Airland technology provides the foundation for building entirely separate titles with their own branding, mechanics, and distribution strategies. These games can be published on the Airland Marketplace, Steam, or the Epic Games Store—with lower fees and fewer restrictions than traditional platforms.

The platform supports large-scale multiplayer systems, enabling professional developers to create experiences that can support thousands of simultaneous players. Advanced physics integration, efficient server management tools, and flexible monetization options ensure that your projects are scalable and sustainable.

The tools are ready. The stage is set. Now it’s time to create, innovate, and lead the next generation of digital entertainment.
